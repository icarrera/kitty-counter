      <p>Note: We're not linking to Grumpy Cat, because, really, what on earth
        does she have to be grumpy about? She gets to travel the world, and on
        top of that she's getting free Friskies for life. Cry me a river about
        how much angst being a star gives you. Plus, one of our team sat
        through that awful Christmas movie from beginning to end, and there's
        no way to get those two hours of life back. Here are some much less
        grumpy kitty sites for you to check out:</p>

      <dd>We're not quite sure why this site is so addicting, but addicting it
        is. It's exactly as described: click and drag the kitties, and they'll
        bounce off the bottom of the window. There's even a place you can click
        to "make it rain" cats (and no dogs...)</dd>
      <dt><h4><a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/cats">Cats on
        Know Your Meme</a></h4></dt>
      <dd>A short history of cats on the Internet. If you have no idea what a
        LOLCat is, this would be a good place to start. (If you don't even
        know what a cat is, that first sentence will explain it all for you.)
      </dd>
      <dt><h4><a href="http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/lolcats">LOLCats on I Can
        Has Cheezburger</a></h4></dt>
        <dd>Though the site as a whole lately has been devoting excessive
        amounts of attention to (ugh) dogs, they're still the main go-to place
        where oodles of cat memes have been and are being created and
        distributed.</dd>

      <dt><h4><a href="http://www.menandcats.com/">Men and Cats</a></h4></dt>
      <dd>The antidote to the crazy-cat-lady stereotype, this is a blog
        featuring photos and videos of men with their feline companions.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dt><h4><a href="https://seattlemeowtropolitan.com/">Seattle Meowtropolitan: Seatte's Cat Cafe</a></h4></dt>
      <dd>Did I just write 'cafes'? Right now there's only one cat cafe in the
        area. Seattle Meowtropolitan has a maximum capacity of 15 patrons
        (so as not to overstimulate their residents), so one must make
        reservations to spend a 50-minute hour with their kitties.</dd>

      <h3>Cat Adoption Services</h3>
        <p>There are so many of these places around the Seattle area that we
          could have spent the whole week compiling a list, but that would have
          left your addition skills untested, so here are just three:</p>
        <p><h4 class="adopt"><a href="http://www.paws.org/cats-and-dogs/shelter/cat-city/">PAWS Cat City</a></h4></p>
